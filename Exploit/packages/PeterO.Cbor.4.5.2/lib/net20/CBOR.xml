            The following is an example of this parameter:
            <c>allowduplicatekeys=true;ctap2Canonical=true</c>. The key can be
            any one of the following where the letters can be any combination
            of basic upper-case and/or basic lower-case letters:
            <c>allowduplicatekeys</c>, <c>ctap2canonical</c>,
            <c>resolvereferences</c>, <c>useindeflengthstrings</c>,
            <c>allowempty</c>, <c>float64</c>, <c>keepkeyorder</c>. Keys
            other than these are ignored in this version of the CBOR library.
            The key <c>float64</c> was introduced in version 4.4 of this
            library. The key <c>keepkeyorder</c> was introduced in version 4.5
            of this library.(Keys are compared using a basic case-insensitive
            comparison, in which two strings are equal if they match after
            converting the basic upper-case letters A to Z (U+0041 to U+005A)
            in both strings to basic lower-case letters.) If two or more
            key/value pairs have equal keys (in a basic case-insensitive
            comparison), the value given for the last such key is used. The
            four keys just given can have a value of <c>1</c>, <c>true</c>,
            <c>yes</c>, or <c>on</c> (where the letters can be any combination
            of basic upper-case and/or basic lower-case letters), which means
            true, and any other value meaning false. For example,
            <c>allowduplicatekeys=Yes</c> and <c>allowduplicatekeys=1</c> both
            set the <c>AllowDuplicateKeys</c> property to true. In the future,
            this class may allow other keys to store other kinds of values, not
            just true or false.</param>

            <remarks>
            <para><b>About sharable objects and references</b></para>
            <para>Sharable objects are marked with tag 28, and references to
            those objects are marked with tag 29 (where a reference of 0 means
            the first sharable object in the CBOR stream, a reference of 1
            means the second, and so on). Sharable strings (byte strings and
            text strings) appear within an enclosing object marked with tag
            256, and references to them are marked with tag 25; in general, a
            string is sharable only if storing its reference rather than the
            string would save space.</para>
            <para>Note that unlike most other tags, these tags generally care
            about the relative order in which objects appear in a CBOR stream;
            thus they are not interoperable with CBOR implementations that
            follow the generic CBOR data model (since they may list map keys in
            an unspecified order). Interoperability problems with these tags
            can be reduced by not using them to mark keys or values of a map or
            to mark objects within those keys or values.</para>
            <para><b>Security Note</b></para>
            <para>When this property is enabled and a decoded CBOR object
            contains references to sharable CBOR objects within it, those
            references will be replaced with the sharable objects they refer to
            (but without making a copy of those objects). However, if shared
            references are deeply nested and used multiple times, these
            references can result in a CBOR object that is orders of magnitude
            bigger than if shared references weren't resolved, and this can
            cause a denial of service when the decoded CBOR object is then
            serialized (e.g., with <c>EncodeToBytes()</c>, <c>ToString()</c>,
            <c>ToJSONString()</c>, or <c>WriteTo</c> ), because object
            references are expanded in the process.</para>
            <para>For example, the following object in CBOR diagnostic
            notation, <c>[28(["xxx", "yyy"]), 28([29(0), 29(0), 29(0)]),
            28([29(1), 29(1)]), 28([29(2), 29(2)]), 28([29(3), 29(3)]),
            28([29(4), 29(4)]), 28([29(5), 29(5)])]</c>, expands to a CBOR
            object with a serialized size of about 1831 bytes when this
            property is enabled, as opposed to about 69 bytes when this
            property is disabled.</para>
            <para>One way to mitigate security issues with this property is to
            limit the maximum supported size a CBORObject can have once
            serialized to CBOR or JSON. This can be done by passing a so-called
            "limited memory stream" to the <c>WriteTo</c> or <c>WriteJSONTo</c>
            methods when serializing the object to JSON or CBOR. A "limited
            memory stream" is a <c>Stream</c> (or <c>OutputStream</c> in Java)
            that throws an exception if it would write more bytes than a given
            maximum size or would seek past that size. (See the documentation
            for <c>CBORObject.WriteTo</c> or <c>CBORObject.WriteJSONTo</c> for
            example code.) Another mitigation is to check the CBOR object's
            type before serializing it, since only arrays and maps can have the
            security problem described here, or to check the maximum nesting
            depth of a CBOR array or map before serializing
            it.</para></remarks>

            <remarks>
            <para><b>Converting CBOR objects</b></para>
            <para>There are many ways to get a CBOR object, including from
            bytes, objects, streams and JSON, as described below.</para>
            <para><b>To and from byte arrays:</b> The
            CBORObject.DecodeFromBytes method converts a byte array in CBOR
            format to a CBOR object. The EncodeToBytes method converts a CBOR
            object to its corresponding byte array in CBOR format.</para>
            <para><b>To and from data streams:</b> The CBORObject.Write methods
            write many kinds of objects to a data stream, including numbers,
            CBOR objects, strings, and arrays of numbers and strings. The
            CBORObject.Read method reads a CBOR object from a data
            stream.</para>
            <para><b>To and from other objects:</b> The
            <c>CBORObject.FromObject</c> method converts many kinds of objects
            to a CBOR object, including numbers, strings, and arrays and maps
            of numbers and strings. Methods like AsNumber and AsString convert
            a CBOR object to different types of object. The
            <c>CBORObject.ToObject</c> method converts a CBOR object to an
            object of a given type; for example, a CBOR array to a native
            <c>List</c> (or <c>ArrayList</c> in Java), or a CBOR integer to an
            <c>int</c> or <c>long</c>.</para>
            <para><b>To and from JSON:</b> This class also doubles as a reader
            and writer of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). The
            CBORObject.FromJSONString method converts JSON in text string form
            to a CBOR object, and the ToJSONString method converts a CBOR
            object to a JSON string. (Note that the conversion from CBOR to
            JSON is not always without loss and may make it impossible to
            recover the original object when converting the JSON back to CBOR.
            See the ToJSONString documentation.) Likewise, ToJSONBytes and
            FromJSONBytes work with JSON in the form of byte arrays rather than
            text strings.</para>
            <para>In addition, the CBORObject.WriteJSON method writes many
            kinds of objects as JSON to a data stream, including numbers, CBOR
            objects, strings, and arrays of numbers and strings. The
            CBORObject.Read method reads a CBOR object from a JSON data
            stream.</para>
            <para><b>Comparison Considerations:</b></para>
            <para>Instances of CBORObject should not be compared for equality
            using the "==" operator; it's possible to create two CBOR objects
            with the same value but not the same reference. (The "==" operator
            might only check if each side of the operator is the same
            instance.)</para>
            <para>This class's natural ordering (under the CompareTo method) is
            consistent with the Equals method, meaning that two values that
            compare as equal under the CompareTo method are also equal under
            the Equals method; this is a change in version 4.0. Two otherwise
            equal objects with different tags are not treated as equal by both
            CompareTo and Equals. To strip the tags from a CBOR object before
            comparing, use the <c>Untag</c> method.</para>
            <para><b>Thread Safety:</b></para>
            <para>Certain CBOR objects are immutable (their values can't be
            changed), so they are inherently safe for use by multiple
            threads.</para>
            <para>CBOR objects that are arrays, maps, and byte strings (whether
            or not they are tagged) are mutable, but this class doesn't attempt
            to synchronize reads and writes to those objects by multiple
            threads, so those objects are not thread safe without such
            synchronization.</para>
            <para>One kind of CBOR object is called a map, or a list of
            key-value pairs. Keys can be any kind of CBOR object, including
            numbers, strings, arrays, and maps. However, untagged text strings
            (which means GetTags returns an empty array and the Type property,
            or "getType()" in Java, returns TextString) are the most suitable
            to use as keys; other kinds of CBOR object are much better used as
            map values instead, keeping in mind that some of them are not
            thread safe without synchronizing reads and writes to them.</para>
            <para>To find the type of a CBOR object, call its Type property (or
            "getType()" in Java). The return value can be Integer,
            FloatingPoint, Boolean, SimpleValue, or TextString for immutable
            CBOR objects, and Array, Map, or ByteString for mutable CBOR
            objects.</para>
            <para><b>Nesting Depth:</b></para>
            <para>The DecodeFromBytes and Read methods can only read objects
            with a limited maximum depth of arrays and maps nested within other
            arrays and maps. The code sets this maximum depth to 500 (allowing
            more than enough nesting for most purposes), but it's possible that
            stack overflows in some runtimes might lower the effective maximum
            nesting depth. When the nesting depth goes above 500, the
            DecodeFromBytes and Read methods throw a CBORException.</para>
            <para>The ReadJSON and FromJSONString methods currently have
            nesting depths of 1000.</para></remarks>

            values, but not <c>CBORObject.Null</c>

            Note that in the case of <c>EFloat</c>
             , if this object represents
            a decimal number with a fractional part, the conversion may lose
            information depending on the number, and if the object is a

            returned is a binary floating-point number rounded to a high but
            limited precision. In the case of <c>EDecimal</c>
             , if this object
            expresses a rational number with a nonterminating decimal
            expansion, returns a decimal number rounded to 34 digits of
            precision. In the case of <c>EInteger</c>
             , if this CBOR object
            expresses a floating-point number, it is converted to an integer by
            discarding its fractional part, and if this CBOR object expresses a
            rational number, it is converted to an integer by dividing the
            numerator by the denominator and discarding the fractional part of
            the result, and this method throws an exception (currently
            OverflowException, but may change in the next major version) if
            this object expresses infinity or a not-a-number value.</item>
            <item>In the.NET version, if the type is a nullable (e.g.,
            <c>Nullable&lt;int&gt;</c>
             or <c>int?</c>
             , returns <c>null</c>
             if
            this CBOR object is null, or this object's value converted to the
            nullable's underlying type, e.g., <c>int</c>
             .</item>

             ) type and this CBOR object is

            constant. (For example, if <c>MyEnum</c>
             includes an entry for
            <c>MyValue</c>
             , this method will return <c>MyEnum.MyValue</c>
             if
            the CBOR object represents <c>"MyValue"</c>
             or the underlying value
            for <c>MyEnum.MyValue</c>
             .) <b>Note:</b>
             If an integer is
            converted to a.NET Enum constant, and that integer is shared by
            more than one constant of the same type, it is undefined which
            constant from among them is returned. (For example, if
            <c>MyEnum.Zero=0</c>
             and <c>MyEnum.Null=0</c>
             , converting 0 to
            <c>MyEnum</c>
             may return either <c>MyEnum.Zero</c>
             or
            <c>MyEnum.Null</c>
             .) As a result, .NET Enum types with constants
            that share an underlying value should not be passed to this
            method.</item>
             <item>If the type is <c>byte[]</c>
             (a
            one-dimensional byte array) and this CBOR object is a byte string,
            returns a byte array which this CBOR byte string's data will be
            copied to. (This method can't be used to encode CBOR data to a byte
            array; for that, use the EncodeToBytes method instead.)</item>
            <item>If the type is a one-dimensional or multidimensional array
            type and this CBOR object is an array, returns an array containing
            the items in this CBOR object.</item>
             <item>If the type is List,
            ReadOnlyCollection or the generic or non-generic IList,
            ICollection, IEnumerable, IReadOnlyCollection, or IReadOnlyList (or
            ArrayList, List, Collection, or Iterable in Java), and if this CBOR
            object is an array, returns an object conforming to the type,
            class, or interface passed to this method, where the object will
            contain all items in this CBOR array.</item>
             <item>If the type is
            Dictionary, ReadOnlyDictionary or the generic or non-generic
            IDictionary or IReadOnlyDictionary (or HashMap or Map in Java), and
            if this CBOR object is a map, returns an object conforming to the
            type, class, or interface passed to this method, where the object
            will contain all keys and values in this CBOR map.</item>
             <item>If
            the type is an enumeration constant ("enum"), and this CBOR object
            is an integer or text string, returns the enumeration constant with
            the given number or name, respectively. (Enumeration constants made
            up of multiple enumeration constants, as allowed by .NET, can only
            be matched by number this way.)</item>
             <item>If the type is
            <c>DateTime</c>
             (or <c>Date</c>
             in Java) , returns a date/time
            object if the CBOR object's outermost tag is 0 or 1. For tag 1,
            this method treats the CBOR object as a number of seconds since the
            start of 1970, which is based on the POSIX definition of "seconds
            since the Epoch", a definition that does not count leap seconds. In
            this method, this number of seconds assumes the use of a proleptic
            Gregorian calendar, in which the rules regarding the number of days
            in each month and which years are leap years are the same for all
            years as they were in 1970 (including without regard to time zone
            differences or transitions from other calendars to the Gregorian).
            The string format used in tag 0 supports only years up to 4 decimal
            digits long. For tag 1, CBOR objects that express infinity or
            not-a-number (NaN) are treated as invalid by this method. This
            default behavior for <c>DateTime</c>
             and <c>Date</c>
             can be changed
            by passing a suitable CBORTypeMapper to this method, such as a
            CBORTypeMapper that registers a CBORDateConverter for
            <c>DateTime</c>
             or <c>Date</c>
             objects. See the examples.</item>
            <item>If the type is <c>Uri</c>
             (or <c>URI</c>
             in Java), returns a
            URI object if possible.</item>
             <item>If the type is <c>Guid</c>
             (or
            <c>UUID</c>
             in Java), returns a UUID object if possible.</item>
            <item>Plain-Old-Data deserialization: If the object is a type not
            specially handled above, the type includes a zero-parameter
            constructor (default or not), this CBOR object is a CBOR map, and
            the "mapper" parameter (if any) allows this type to be eligible for
            Plain-Old-Data deserialization, then this method checks the given
            type for eligible setters as follows:</item>
             <item>(*) In the .NET
            version, eligible setters are the public, nonstatic setters of
            properties with a public, nonstatic getter. Eligible setters also
            include public, nonstatic, non- <c>const</c>
             , non- <c>readonly</c>
            fields. If a class has two properties and/or fields of the form "X"
            and "IsX", where "X" is any name, or has multiple properties and/or
            fields with the same name, those properties and fields are
            ignored.</item>
             <item>(*) In the Java version, eligible setters are
            public, nonstatic methods starting with "set" followed by a
            character other than a basic digit or lower-case letter, that is,
            other than "a" to "z" or "0" to "9", that take one parameter. The
            class containing an eligible setter must have a public, nonstatic
            method with the same name, but starting with "get" or "is" rather
            than "set", that takes no parameters and does not return void. (For
            example, if a class has "public setValue(String)" and "public
            getValue()", "setValue" is an eligible setter. However,
            "setValue()" and "setValue(String, int)" are not eligible setters.)
            In addition, public, nonstatic, nonfinal fields are also eligible
            setters. If a class has two or more otherwise eligible setters
            (methods and/or fields) with the same name, but different parameter
            type, they are not eligible setters.</item>
             <item>Then, the method
            creates an object of the given type and invokes each eligible
            setter with the corresponding value in the CBOR map, if any. Key
            names in the map are matched to eligible setters according to the
            rules described in the <see cref='T:PeterO.Cbor.PODOptions'/>
            documentation. Note that for security reasons, certain types are
            not supported even if they contain eligible setters. For the Java
            version, the object creation may fail in the case of a nested
            nonstatic class.</item>

            DotNet version) uses a CBORTypeMapper to change how CBOR objects
            are converted to DateTime objects. In this case, the ToObject
            method assumes the CBOR object is an untagged number giving the
            number of seconds since the start of 1970.</para>

            nonstatic getters of read/write properties (and also those of
            read-only properties in the case of a compiler-generated type or an
            F# type). Eligible getters also include public, nonstatic, non-
            <c>const</c>
             , non- <c>readonly</c>
             fields. If a class has two
            properties and/or fields of the form "X" and "IsX", where "X" is
            any name, or has multiple properties and/or fields with the same
            name, those properties and fields are ignored.</item>
             <item>(*) In
            the Java version, eligible getters are public, nonstatic methods
            starting with "get" or "is" (either word followed by a character
            other than a basic digit or lower-case letter, that is, other than
            "a" to "z" or "0" to "9"), that take no parameters and do not
            return void, except that methods named "getClass" are not eligible
            getters. In addition, public, nonstatic, nonfinal fields are also
            eligible getters. If a class has two otherwise eligible getters
            (methods and/or fields) of the form "isX" and "getX", where "X" is
            the same in both, or two such getters with the same name but
            different return type, they are not eligible getters.</item>
            <item>Then, the method returns a CBOR map with each eligible
            getter's name or property name as each key, and with the
            corresponding value returned by that getter as that key's value.
            Before adding a key-value pair to the map, the key's name is
            adjusted according to the rules described in the <see
            cref='T:PeterO.Cbor.PODOptions'/> documentation. Note that for
            security reasons, certain types are not supported even if they

            according to RFC6901, or a default value if the operation fails.
            The syntax for a JSON Pointer is:
            <pre>'/' KEY '/' KEY [...]</pre> where KEY represents a key into
            the JSON object or its sub-objects in the hierarchy. For example,
            <pre>/foo/2/bar</pre> means the same as
            <pre>obj['foo'][2]['bar']</pre> in JavaScript. If "~" and/or "/"
            occurs in a key, it must be escaped with "~0" or "~1",
            respectively, in a JSON pointer. JSON pointers also support the
            special key "-" (as in "/foo/-") to indicate the end of an array,
            but this method treats this key as an error since it refers to a
            nonexistent item. Indices to arrays (such as 2 in the example) must
            contain only basic digits 0 to 9 and no leading zeros. (Note that
            RFC 6901 was published before JSON was extended to support
            top-level values other than arrays and key-value
            dictionaries.).</summary>

            <param name='paramString'>A string setting forth the options to
            use. This is a semicolon-separated list of options, each of which
            has a key and a value separated by an equal sign ("="). Whitespace
            and line separators are not allowed to appear between the
            semicolons or between the equal signs, nor may the string begin or
            end with whitespace. The string can be empty, but cannot be null.
            The following is an example of this parameter:
            <c>usecamelcase=true</c>. The key can be any one of the following
            where the letters can be any combination of basic upper-case and/or
            basic lower-case letters: <c>usecamelcase</c>. Other keys are
            ignored in this version of the CBOR library. (Keys are compared
            using a basic case-insensitive comparison, in which two strings are
            equal if they match after converting the basic upper-case letters A
            to Z (U+0041 to U+005A) in both strings to basic lower-case
            letters.) If two or more key/value pairs have equal keys (in a
            basic case-insensitive comparison), the value given for the last
            such key is used. The key just given can have a value of <c>1</c>,
            <c>true</c>, <c>yes</c>, or <c>on</c> (where the letters can be
            any combination of basic upper-case and/or basic lower-case
            letters), which means true, and any other value meaning false. For
            example, <c>usecamelcase=Yes</c> and <c>usecamelcase=1</c> both set
            the <c>UseCamelCase</c> property to true. In the future, this class
            may allow other keys to store other kinds of values, not just true
            or false.</param>

            U+10000 or higher, in UTF-16. A surrogate pair is a high surrogate,
            U+D800 to U+DBFF, followed by a low surrogate, U+DC00 to U+DFFF. An
            unpaired surrogate code point is a surrogate not appearing in a
            surrogate pair.) Many of the methods in this class allow setting
            the behavior to follow when unpaired surrogate code points are
            found in text strings, such as throwing an error or treating the
            unpaired surrogate as a replacement character
            (U+FFFD).</para></summary>
